# MSVMD: A Multi-Scenario Visual Measurement Dataset for Transmission Line Safety Monitoring Under Complex Conditions
Accurate and reliable monitoring of transmission lines is essential for the safe operation of power grids, especially under complex and adverse environmental conditions. Current transmission line monitoring largely relies on deep learning–based, non-contact visual measurement methods, whose effectiveness is highly dependent on the quality of the underlying datasets. However, most existing public datasets are collected under normal weather and illumination conditions, and their annotation quality is often insufficient, which limits their applicability to real-world safety monitoring scenarios. To address this limitation, this paper presents MSVMD, a multi-scenario visual measurement dataset for transmission line monitoring. The dataset contains 4,000 finely annotated images acquired by fixed cameras mounted on transmission towers, covering highly challenging scenarios such as rain, snow, nighttime conditions, and complex illumination. A spatiotemporal random sampling strategy combined with a two-stage data filtering process is adopted to make the data distribution closer to real operating conditions and to increase the proportion of safety-critical scenarios. In addition, a hybrid annotation strategy is designed to balance annotation efficiency and accuracy, providing reliable pixel-level measurement ground truth. Experiments conducted on 18 representative segmentation-based visual measurement models demonstrate that MSVMD effectively reveals performance differences among models under complex operating conditions, highlighting their strengths and limitations in safety-oriented transmission line monitoring tasks. Additional experiments further verify the effectiveness of the proposed annotation strategy.


The dataset covers multiple scenarios, and several groups of representative scenarios along with their corresponding annotation information are shown in the figure.
